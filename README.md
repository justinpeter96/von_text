Description of vMF distributions

## Abstract
Finite mixture model is an effective tool for modeling complex, heterogeneous data. Clustering on unit hypersphere using finite mix ture of von Mises-Fisher Distributions was introduced by (1). This model is known to be effective for clustering text data. In this paper, we will describe the application of von Mises-Fisher mixture model on movie description of crime genre from the internet movies database (IMDB). The objective is to identify movies of similar types within the crime genre and observe the change in movie content over time.
